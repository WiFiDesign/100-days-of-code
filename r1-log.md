# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Will Fischer

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on January 9th, 2018.

## Log

### R1D1 
Made a basic page using just html and css showing the places I have travelled with my wife so far. Page took much longer than I expected and the code is very rough and not responsive. Will probably come back and make edits in the future.

### R1D2
Spent a lot of time playing with flexbox and bootstrap with not much to show for it. A bit discouraged by the end result, but happy about the time put in. Tomorrow is another day.
