        <p>Just like you, Tannen, I take every advantage I can get. Now are you gonna check your iron? I was joking with your deputy. Of course I'm going to check my iron. We all were, weren't we boys? (They all give over their guns.) Yeah. Right. Tannen...your knife, too. (Angry, Tannen takes the knife that was concealed in his boot and throws it like a dart onto a table nearby. Then he faces the Marshall.)Smile, Marshall. After all this is a party.Hey Biff, she's all fixed up just like you wanted, but I couldn't get it started! You got some kind of a kill switch on this thing? (The camera pulls out to reveal 2015 Biff behind a tree. He watches as 1955 Biff opens the car door and gets in.) No, you just got to have the right touch. Nobody can start this car but me. The bill comes to $302 and 57 cents... 300 bucks? (He gets out of the car.) 300 bucks for a couple of dents? No, hey, that's bullshit Terry.Are you okay? (Lorraine takes his hand and he helps her up. They walk off into the dance.) Who is that guy. That's George McFly. That's George McFly?(Clara pops up at Doc's side.) We'll discuss this later. No, we'll discuss this now...late? Thank you for your gallantry, Mr. Eastwood. (modestly) No, hey, ma'am.</p>
